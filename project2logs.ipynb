    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "DistilBERT-base-uncased is a model famous for sentiment analysis. We want to train it and see if the model can detect toxic comments. \n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "- 1000 youtube comment on Ferguson arrest from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/youtube-toxicity-data/data\n",
    "- Label toxicity, obscenity, sexist, homophobic, and so on\n",
    "- Taking comment and toxicity lable as our dataset\n",
    "- Has almost 50/50 percentage of both toxic and non-toxic comments\n",
    "- The video involved government and police aspects, which might impact the training of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The model can detect toxicity in text with accuracy around 80%.\n",
    "- Might not accurately predict data outside the dataset, as overfitting occured (higher validation loss than training loss).\n",
    "- There is limitation due to context dependency, language development and subjectivity. \n",
    "- To improve, use larger dataset, add more parameters, and use a better hardware.\n",
    "### Future work:\n",
    "- A multi-label classification to further specify the comments. eg. threat, insult, hatecrime.\n",
    "- Evaluate by checking unintended bias in the model by using ROC and F1 score.\n",
    "- When tested with our own comments; we found that those that contains slightly negative words are marked as toxic, so it cannot do a more complex concept like sarcasm.\n"

Whites were enslaved by blacks first, and for over 150 years. This was when Europeans(the same race that started America and later enslaved Africans) began searching North Africa to establish trade of goods between natives. From the 1520s to the late 1600s whites were enslaved first. Later the tables turned. This boys and girls is called 'Karma.'\\n4. Statistically over 50% of murders in the US alone are from Blacks, despite them making up only 14.1% of the entire US population, while despite whites make up 63% of the US population they only make up 46% of the murders.\\n5. Whites make up 38% of welfare recipients with blacks making up 39%. This doesn't seem extreme until you realize that 39%(blacks) consists of that 14.1%, whith that 38%(whites) making up 63% of the US.

Unfortunately, on this day, he chose the wrong pathway to his fate.\\xa0\\n\\nYou cannot rob a store and call it shoplifting. Heck, you might as well call it borrowing without permission.\\xa0\\n\\nThis was not his first crime and there were probably many unrecorded (not caught) negative actions by Mike Brown (MB). You cannot assault another human being without consequences. Or should we say \"he was just playing, it was no big deal, or it was childish\". Get real folks. The riots, looting, attacks, and threats has nothing to do with MB.

That was not, nor is childish behaviors. His behaviors were felonious and criminal. And to be frank, would have probably cost him his life elsewhere at a different time. REAL PARENTS would have stated, \"This was my son. What he did was wrong in this store and to the clerk. If in fact, the evidence shows my son assaulted this officer, and posed a threat by going after the officer before the shots were fired... Then may our son rest in peace as his actions we do not condone but this consequence was just due to his own choices and actions. We unconditionally love our son. However, we also forgive the officer. We apologize to the store clerk and we hope as a family and people can move on only to learn, our actions and how we live dictate our consequences, be it positive or negative.

As a human, as a race, we need to be accountable for what we say and do.\\xa0\\n\\nLastly, If the officer was racist and he did shoot MB without rhyme or reason, or if he in fact, just targeted MB & DJ because they were black, and decided to gun down MB (in the back and front) even though he surrendered peacefully with his hands raised, THEN I would side with MB and those who support the cause.\\n\\nBut unfortunately, the evidence thus far does not support the above paragraph.\\xa0\\n\\nQuestion 1: Would this still be the reaction, if the officer were a female?\\n\\nQuestion 2: Would this still be the reaction, if the officer were Black/African American?\\n\\nQuestion 3: Would this still be the reaction, if Mike Brown was gunned down by a peer of his own race?\\n\\nQuestion 4: Would this still be the reaction, if Mike Brown were White?\\n\\nQuestion 5: Would this still be the end result (death), if Mike Brown was productive at home, work, or school other than running the streets?\\n\\nTo the people:\\n\\n\"Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.\" - Martin Luther King, Jr.\\nI think it is safe to say, we are living in dangerous times because of this simple fact proving \\xa0this Martin Luther King, Jr.\\'s quote. \\xa0Unfortunately, it is coming from his own race and those supporting a lost cause.\\n\\nTo the people who cry wolf...\\n\\nMJ\\n\\nPlease Repost!\\ufeff',\n",

Stop pointing the finger and address the problems black teens have with their lack of male role models.\\n\\n3-With that being said, black people need to address the alternatives of dealing with suspects/victims with non-lethal weaponry to deal with these encounters. If we as a race start to focus on solutions to a possible violent encounter with alternatives, then we can see progress with the police.\\n\\n4- You can't go out and protest and burn down your communities in retalitation against a police, this only supports a theory that Brown was a product of a violent environment.

Seventy-two percent of black children are born to single mothers. \\xa0Why get married or limit the number of children you have, when Obama and the progressives will gladly extort taxpayer money to take care of you and your illegitimate children in exchange for guaranteed votes to keep themselves in power. \\xa0This master plan and policy insures generations of newly created disaffected and dysfunctional adults who will necessarily become democratic voters.\\n\\nIf the race hustlers mentioned above, reacted in the same way to black on black killings, they could go into those neighborhoods and with their power, wipe out all the gangs, minimize the drug use and give the community some real “hope” and “change.” \\xa0It will never happen. \\xa0They need black communities to be dependent and feel hopeless in order to maintain their power and control. \\xa0They are living the good life off the backs of their own people, while deceiving them into thinking they care. \\xa0Just think – if these purveyors of lies and damn lies couldn't make race an issue over the past 40 years they would have to get “real” jobs like the rest of us.\",\n",
